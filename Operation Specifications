Operation Specifications
Password Generation Protocol
Passwords must be generated on a permanently air-gapped computer that has never been connected to any network.

Passwords must be generated using a secure random password generator, containing uppercase letters, lowercase letters, spaces, special characters, and numbers.

Each password must be at least 32 characters in length; 200 characters or more is recommended.

Password Storage Protocol
Password records must be stored exclusively on a dedicated USB drive, and must never be connected to any networked device.

The USB drive must be encrypted with VeraCrypt or an equivalent full-disk encryption tool to prevent data loss in case of theft or misplacement.

The password book must contain machine-generated random passwords, with a different password for each day (1stâ€“31st).

The password book has a maximum validity period of one month, after which it must be completely replaced.

After each day's use, the corresponding day's password entry must be immediately destroyed.

Password Exchange Protocol
Passwords or password books must be exchanged physically in-person whenever possible.

If physical exchange is not feasible, use secure communication channels such as Signal, ensuring end-to-end encryption.

Prior to exchanging sensitive data, public keys must be exchanged using RSA-4096 encryption.

After key exchange, a voice call must be conducted to verify the key fingerprints, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

Content Encryption Protocol
Avoid encrypting repeated or predictable plaintexts (e.g., common phrases like "Hi") to mitigate known-plaintext attacks.

Vary writing style and vocabulary across communications to avoid creating detectable patterns that could aid cryptanalysis.

Capture Contingency Protocol
In the event of a raid or imminent capture, immediately destroy any USB drives and flash memory devices carrying sensitive information.

Passwords must be machine-generated and not memorized, ensuring that even under interrogation, the user cannot recall or disclose password content.
